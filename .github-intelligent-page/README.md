### Intelligence for GitHub Pages — auto-generated documentation sites, dashboards, and public-facing content.

---

## What It Acts On

| Trigger / Data | Description |
|---|---|
| **Repository content** | Reads source code, documentation files, and configuration to generate site content |
| **Agent session history** | Reads past conversations and Q&A interactions to build searchable resources |
| **Skill files** | Reads `.pi/skills/` to generate a browsable catalog of available agent capabilities |
| **Project state** | Reads open issues, PR status, release history, and security posture for status pages |
| **Pages deployment config** | Reads deployment source (branch or Actions) and custom domain settings |

## What It Acts In

| Surface | How the Agent Participates |
|---|---|
| **Documentation site** | Generates and maintains a documentation site from repo content, deployed via Pages |
| **Agent dashboard** | Publishes a live dashboard showing agent activity — recent conversations, open investigations, memory highlights, usage metrics |
| **Skill catalog** | Creates a browsable catalog of available agent skills, generated from skill files |
| **Session viewer** | Provides a web-based viewer for agent conversation sessions — richer than raw JSONL files |
| **Project status page** | Auto-generates a project status page with open issues, PR state, release history, and security posture |
| **Interactive FAQ** | Builds a searchable FAQ from the agent's past Q&A interactions across issues and discussions |
