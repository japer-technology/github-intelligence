### Intelligence for notifications — smart digests, deduplication, and activity summarization.

---

## What It Acts On

| Trigger / Data | Description |
|---|---|
| **Repository activity feed** | Monitors the stream of events — issue updates, PR changes, review activity, CI status |
| **Subscriptions** | Tracks what users and teams are watching across repos, issues, and PRs |
| **@mention notifications** | Reads notifications triggered by @mentions and review requests |
| **CI/CD status notifications** | Monitors build and deployment status updates |
| **Notification volume** | Detects patterns of notification overload across team members |

## What It Acts In

| Surface | How the Agent Participates |
|---|---|
| **Smart notification digest** | Generates a daily or weekly digest of important activity — summarizing instead of flooding |
| **Notification deduplication** | Consolidates related notifications into summaries to reduce notification fatigue |
| **Escalation routing** | When the agent detects high-priority issues, routes notifications to the appropriate team or individual |
| **Activity summaries** | Posts periodic summaries of repository activity — what happened, what needs attention, what was resolved |
| **Priority filtering** | Identifies and highlights the most important notifications based on context and urgency |
